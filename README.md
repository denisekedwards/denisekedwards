- 👋 Hi, I’m @denisekedwards and I'm a web and digital content strategist. 
- 👀 In addition to content and design, I’m interested in front-end development. 
- 🌱 I'm currently focusing on mastering JavaScript, but I've also dabbled a little bit in Python. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others to improve websites, web apps, and digital platforms.
